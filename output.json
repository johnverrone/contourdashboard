If this is the best Cox can do then it's probably time to look into changing cable/internet providers."

Now I can't watch anything on the ipad because it thinks I'm not at home. Network rebooting and reinstalls do nothing to jog it back to reality. However, I can still use the \"send to tv\" option with no issues which is not very useful because I'm sitting at home in the first place.6 Jun 2014 update applied. Failed to fix problem. Removed and reinstalled from scratch, kittens are still sad.25 Jul update: something made it work again yippie!"

All most people want to know is \"WHAT'S ON TV?\" I don't care about genres. How about a simple list from top to bottom of the channels you pump into my home? How about making that list easy to find and simple to read? Hell, I'd settle for a web site but the Cox site which has such a list doesn't work half the time. Cable television is becoming more and more obsolete. I would think Cox would write apps that help their customers use their products instead of frustrate them."

If you are looking for a program titled \"Rosy Day\" and you paste the entire title in, rather than Rosy Day being the first option, The Last of the Mohicans is shown first, and the show Rosy Day isn't listed without scrolling really far right. If instead you only enter \"rosy\" you will get the desired Rosy Day (92618 market on June 23, 2014). It looks like they're doing an \"or\" search on any words without any priority on all entered words let alone those in the same order and proximity.Also there's no apparent way to quickly jump to a channel or time which I was hoping would at least be improved from their Cox Connect app, which is all buggy but at least doesn't make you scroll through all the channels to get to where you want to go.Using Cox apps makes me wish I had Comcast again (not available in my current market) to at least have apps that are usable.Before you release another app, try them out on your highest-level executive who is the least computer/mobile knowledgable unless you're afraid of getting fired."

It works reliably less than 50% of the time. Also, if I can only connect in my house, then why not give the local channels too? I guess one thing at a time, fix the app first, then give us the channels."

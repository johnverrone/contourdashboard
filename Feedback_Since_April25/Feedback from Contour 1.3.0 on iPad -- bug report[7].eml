------------------
Your app is terrible and does not work.  I cannot utilize the app as
described.  I cannot watch live TV nor watch any on demand programming.  You
took away the "TV Connect" app, which worked perfectly, and replaced it with
this non-functioning, worthless waste of memory/storage space.  Why even
make this app available when it does not work?  I wish FiOS was in this area
as I would drop Cox in a heartbeat.  Since you do not have any competition
in this area, you feel like you can treat customers any way you see fit,
including making promises on your Contour app and service, getting people to
sign up for it, taking their money, and failing to deliver.  You should be
ashamed of yourselves.  I will tell all of my friends and family to stay
away from Cox and sign up for satellite service if Verizon FiOS or Comcast
is unavailable in their area.  You should give me a refund on my bill.   Cox
is a fraud.

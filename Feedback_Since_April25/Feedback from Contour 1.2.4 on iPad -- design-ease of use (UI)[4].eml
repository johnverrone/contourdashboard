Hello,

For your App Design people.
You need to be made aware that you have designed the most useless and
confusing and non-functional app I have EVER seen, and I have at least 350
apps on my device.

Now, I must say it does "cool things" in the same way
that one could say that some CGI graphics are cool in a movie. However in a
movie, if the story is totally nonsensical and is an "assault upon the human
brain" - that would be a description of your app.

People want to "do
something useful" with an app, and if it's an app that has "shows" on it,
then it means one wants to do something useful in accessing those shows and
seeing those shows.

Your app has done nothing but ASSAULT ME in trying to
do ANYTHING useful with shows. It's amazing to see that this level of
assault was even possible ... but you have certainly accomplished it.

I'm
totally flabbergasted it was even possible to have app design people put
together something that "looks cool" and yet assaults the user at the same
time.

I hope you get some new design people and TOTALLY REWRITE your app
from the ground up, starting with a concept that has RATIONALITY attached to
it.

I don't hardly ever write to complain about things, but you have
certainly managed to get me to do so with this app.

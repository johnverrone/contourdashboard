------------------
Great concept, much like Netflix in a way, but what it lacks are
descriptions of what season, what episode, etc.  Another helpful thing would
be a text version of this app in settings, if preferred. The way it's set up
now is confusing, even with the tutorial, because it just repeats the
episode names over and over with no obvious description. I'm fumbling around
clicking every thumbnail with the show I want, trying to figure out what
episode is what. Reading a quick synopsis doesn't help when I'm unsure of
what season something happened in. Warehouse 13 for example, tons of
thumbnails all exactly the same picture and wording. I randomly click one
and don't recognize your description of the episode so I click another
random thumbnail and it's telling me more info I don't know and I still
haven't found the 1st episode of the last season because there's no way to
tell what you're watching. Unless you know the exact year and month the
episode you want aired. Then I'd still have to randomly click thumbnails
till I found it. There has to be a better way. The search engine works fine
but there's no way to know what you're watching until you click it and start
watching. I hope that makes sense. Very frustrating.

------------------
In order to use a number of apps, such
as the ABC television app, I am required to confirm that I am a Cox customer
by logging in. However, part of that login is that Cox wants me to confirm
my primary email address. I have attempted this many times, both on my
tablet and home computer. Each attempt always ends in some unexpected system
failure. Always. As a result, I am not able to use certain apps that are
dependent on a Cox account. 

What is somewhat comical about this is that
within a few minutes of the failure and me logging off in frustration, I
receive an email from Cox informing me that "I have just one more step" in
getting that completed login. If Cox supposedly needs me to confirm my email
address, then why are you able to send an email informing me that I need to
confirm the email address to which you just sent the notification? Could
this please get fixed?

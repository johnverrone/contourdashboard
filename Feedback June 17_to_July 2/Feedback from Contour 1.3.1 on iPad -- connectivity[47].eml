Feedback Received:
------------------
Very frequent lag and app crashes, mostly during the day. At night not so
much. Usually have pretty good signal, the wireless is not dropping bars or
getting disconnected. Tried disabling any other nearby wireless and blue
tooth devices and still get lag and drops using contour of the older app (TV
Connect?). I tried looking for a buffer option but did not see one.
Thoughts?
